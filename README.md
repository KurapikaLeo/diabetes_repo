This project makes use of the pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

## Aim
- Create a model that can predict the probability of a patient getting diabetes, based on the set of target features chosen to train the model.
- Test the model target feature : outcome.
- Explore the dataset -> notice if there are null values or duplicate values which would need to be removed in the model preparation.
- Test the performance of the chosen machine learning algorithms.
- Compare the models against each other based on the performance , especially on true negative and true positive performance.

## End Result
- The Random Forest Classifier algorithm model provides the highest level of accuracy with 97.48 %.
